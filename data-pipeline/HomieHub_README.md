# HomieHub ETL Data Pipeline

## 1. Project Overview
HomieHub is an automated, end-to-end data pipeline built to process unstructured housing-related data (such as WhatsApp listings) into structured, verified, and normalized datasets ready for downstream analysis. 
The project demonstrates modern **MLOps practices** including modular code organization, Airflow-based orchestration, Dockerized reproducibility, and automated logging and notifications.

---

## 2. DAG Overview and Architecture
The central orchestrator is the **Airflow DAG**: `homiehub_data_pipeline.py`.

- **Tasks:** Extract → Transform → Save → Push Summary → Email Notification
- **Key Outputs:** Processed CSVs stored under `/data/processed/`
- **Scheduling:** Daily (configurable), with retries and email alerts

This DAG manages data flow dependencies, ensuring reliable task execution and logging at every stage.

## 4. Data Acquisition and Ingestion

The pipeline begins by extracting unstructured housing data from WhatsApp chat exports using an NLP-based extraction module:

- **File:** `src/extraction/whatsapp_data_extraction.py`
- **Description:** Parses WhatsApp text files and converts conversational posts into structured CSVs (`structured_listings_nlp.csv`).
- **Output Directory:** `/data/raw/`

Once extracted, the data is ingested via:
- **File:** `src/ingestion/data_handlers/csv_extractor.py`
- **Purpose:** Safely reads CSVs with custom NA handling and validates file availability before transformation.
- **Output:** A `pandas` DataFrame ready for downstream preprocessing.

This ensures a reproducible and traceable data ingestion process from raw text to structured CSVs.

---

## 5. Data Preprocessing and Transformation

The pre-processing step standardizes and cleans the structured CSV:

- **File:** `src/preprocessing/transform.py`
- **Tasks:**
  - Normalizes categorical features (`gender`, `accom_type`, `food_pref`, `area`).
  - Converts monetary and numeric fields (`rent_amount_num`, `lease_duration_months`, `distance_to_campus_miles`).
  - Parses boolean indicators (`furnished_bool`, `utilities_included_bool`, etc.).
  - Generates standardized ISO date formats and derived columns.
- **Output Directory:** `/data/processed/`

All transformations are modular and deterministic to guarantee reproducibility across pipeline runs.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

Airflow’s native logging system is enhanced with custom notifications and log bundling.

- Each task logs execution status and runtime metadata (start time, end time, duration).
- A summary of the run, including **rows processed and validation statistics**, is sent via email at the end of each run.
- Failure and success states are captured separately, with corresponding log attachments.
- Logs for all tasks are bundled and sent automatically to the pipeline administrator.

### Example Notifications and Logs:

#### ✅ Successful Completion Email
![ETL Completion](assets/3_email_logging1.jpg)
> “ETL Completed Successfully – Processed 25 Rows.”

#### ⚠️ Failure Alert Email
![Airflow Failure Alert](assets/4_email_log2.jpg)
> Email Operator alerts triggered on failed runs with detailed exception trace.

#### 📦 ETL Log Attachments

> All task logs (attempt logs per operator) automatically attached for audit and troubleshooting.

Airflow’s native logging system is enhanced with custom notifications and log bundling:

- Each task logs execution status and time to `logs/`.
- A summary of the run (rows processed, start/end time) is sent via email.
- Task logs are bundled and attached to the email for reference.
- Failure alerts are automatically triggered with detailed error information.

**Example Success Notification:**
> “ETL Completed Successfully – Processed 25 Rows.”

**Example Failure Notification:**
> “Airflow Alert – Task Failure (SMTP Host Unreachable).”

---

## 7. Reproducibility and Containerization

Reproducibility is ensured through containerized deployment using Docker.

- **Files:**
  - `docker-compose.yaml`: Launches Airflow services.
  - `setup.sh`: Automates environment setup.
  - `requirements.txt`: Captures dependency versions.

All configurations and data paths are abstracted through `src/utils/io.py`, maintaining consistent directory resolution across environments.

---

## 8. Testing and Validation

Automated tests ensure correctness of core data processing functions.

- **Framework:** `pytest`
- **Test Modules:**
  - `test/test_transform.py` – validates transformations (dates, numerics, booleans).
  - `test/test_schema.py` – ensures schema consistency across pipeline runs.

**Run Command:**
```bash
pytest -v
```
Testing confirms stable schema and value integrity between raw and processed datasets.

*(If tests are not yet implemented, placeholders have been added to be integrated in the next iteration.)*

---

## 9. Data Versioning with DVC

To maintain data lineage and reproducibility, **DVC (Data Version Control)** will be used to track all dataset versions.

- **Setup:**
```bash
dvc init
dvc add data/raw data/processed
dvc remote add -d homiehub_drive <remote-url>
```
- **Tracked Artifacts:** Raw and processed CSVs
- **Configuration Files:** `.dvc`, `dvc.yaml`
- **Purpose:** Ensures consistent snapshots of datasets tied to specific DAG runs or Git commits.

---

## 10. Metrics and Tracking

At the end of each pipeline run, a summary is generated and emailed automatically.

**Metrics Captured:**
- Number of rows processed
- Start and end timestamps
- Success/Failure status
- Run ID and log file bundle

Future enhancements will include integration with **MLflow** to track additional metrics such as record distribution, error rates, and transformation latency.

---

## 11. Error Handling and Notifications

The DAG is configured with built-in retries and detailed email notifications.

- **Retries:** 2 attempts per task with a 3-minute delay.
- **Failure Alerts:** Triggered via `EmailOperator` upon task failure.
- **Success Alerts:** Summary email confirms successful ETL completion.
- **Log Bundling:** All per-task logs are zipped and emailed post-run.

**Example Notifications:**
- **Success Email:** “ETL Completed Successfully – Processed 25 Rows.”
- **Failure Email:** “Airflow Alert – Task Failure (SMTP Host Unreachable).”

---


## 14. Schema Validation and Statistics Generation

HomieHub’s pipeline integrates automated **schema and data statistics generation** directly within the ETL workflow.

While external libraries such as *Great Expectations* or *TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)* can be integrated, the current implementation already validates data quality through in-pipeline checks and automated summaries.

### Key Implementations:
- **Schema Validation:**
  - During ingestion and transformation, the pipeline verifies the presence of all mandatory columns:
    `['timestamp', 'rent_amount', 'gender', 'accom_type', 'food_pref', 'area']`
  - Missing or unexpected columns trigger logged warnings and are flagged in the email summary.
  - Datatype consistency is validated after transformation (numeric, boolean, categorical fields).

- **Statistics Generation:**
  - The pipeline computes key data statistics per run and embeds them in the **ETL Summary Email**:
    - Total rows processed
    - Null value counts per column
    - Percentage of missing values
    - Average, minimum, and maximum rent amount
  - These metrics are written to the Airflow logs and attached to the summary email.

- **Quality Assurance via Logs:**
  - Each task logs schema shape, column counts, and transformation summaries.
  - Logs are automatically bundled and sent to the pipeline administrator after every DAG run.

### Example of Logged Statistics (from ETL summary email):
```
ETL Summary:
- Rows processed: 25
- Columns validated: 12
- Missing values: 0.8%
- Average Rent: $1,320.50
- Outlier threshold breaches: 0
```

These built-in validations and metrics provide automated, reproducible **data quality monitoring** at every pipeline run, ensuring that each dataset version meets the required schema integrity and consistency standards.

## 12. Future Enhancements


- Add DVC tracking and remote configuration for dataset versioning.
- Integrate `pytest` validation in CI/CD workflow.
- Incorporate MLflow for run-level metric tracking.
- Implement lightweight bias monitoring on demographic distributions.
- Automate deployment on a cloud-hosted Airflow instance (e.g., Composer, MWAA).
